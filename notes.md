# Python Virtual Environment (VENV)

I created a Python virtual environment for this project's dependencies.  
It is installed **outside the synchronized project folder**, in the Docker containerâ€™s home directory, to keep it separate from the project files.

## Activation
```bash
source ~/env/bin/activate
```

## Deactivation
```bash
deactivate
```
